We added a supplemental file full of prime integers for the program since our blocking size is 4. 
Location: /EncryptedChat/resources/prime.txt
File: prime.txt

- Main Window
When running the program, the user will be faced with a window(referred to as main window) that has two buttons from left to right labeled as "Connect as Server" and "Connect as Client".
The main window will hold both the "File" menu option and the "Help" menu option. 
The "Help" menu option has both the "About Us" option and the "Connection Help" option.
 
- Server Window
The connect as server button will open up a new window that has a "Start Listening" button .
The button will cause the server window to display an IP Address and a port number needed for the client to connect.
Furthermore, the server window holds two text boxes where the left one will print out the messages the clients send to one another and the right one being the text box that displays all the clients connected to the server.

- Client Window
The user will be faced with a window that has text entries for the "Server Address", the "Server Port", the "Message" and the "Client ID". There are also two buttons that connects to the server and that sends the message to the client desired.

"Server Address" can be the default number if the client and server are on the same local machine. 
If not, then change the address to the value provided by the server. 
"Server Port" has to be the value provided in the server.
"Message" type in the message that you would like to send to a specified client. 
"Client ID" The ID starts from 10001 and each new client made after will have previous CLIENT ID plus 1;

Once data is inputted, the user should click the "Connect to Server" button. The user will be followed with two prompts to input a prime number greater than 16410. Afterwards, the user can send a message to the client of their choice!
